## 📲 Instafel Updater (Standalone App)

**Instafel Updater** is a lightweight, standalone Android application responsible for managing and installing new builds of the Instafel app. It works as the bridge between the patcher backend and the end-user, making it easier to stay up-to-date with the latest experimental Instagram Alpha releases — without needing to manually search for download links or APKs.

### 🧩 What Is Its Purpose?

The Instafel Updater is not a patcher itself — it does **not create builds**. Instead, it serves as an **installer and update manager** that:

- Downloads the latest pre-patched Instafel APKs
- Detects your currently installed variant (clone or unclone)
- Notifies you about updates
- Installs new builds with one tap (or it even can update it automatically with Shizuku-Root permission)

### 🛠️ Key Features

- ⚡ **Fast Build Delivery** — Direct download of the latest approved Instafel builds  
- 🔄 **Seamless In-App Installation** — No need for external APK management  
- 🧠 **Smart Variant Matching** — Clone users get clone builds, unclone users get unclone builds  
- 🛡️ **Safe Updates** — Builds are tested and approved before they go live  
- 📦 **Compact Size** — The updater itself is small and efficient  

---

### ⚠️ Notes & Limitations

- The Updater does **not allow switching between clone/unclone.** That still requires manual uninstall/reinstall.
- If your current Instafel installation is broken, the Updater might not detect it. In such cases, a clean reinstall may be necessary.
- The app relies on the Instafel servers. If servers or the patcher backend are temporarily offline, updates may not be available temporarily.
